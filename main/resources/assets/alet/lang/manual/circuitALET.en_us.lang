manual.page={scale:2.0}{newLines:0}{bold}Little Circuits{end}{scale:1.1}{color:65535}{italic}{newLines:2}   Little Circuits{end}{scale:1.0} are premade structures designed for commonly needed operations with signaling. Most of these provided functions would require advanced logic gate knowledge to be made. Such processes include Switches, Memory, a Random Number Generator, and an Integer Magnitude Comparator. They are hard-coded, meaning they are not programmed using the signaling interface. {end}{scale:1.0}{underline}Do Not{end}{scale:1.0} modify the signaling of the inputs or outputs. Doing so will break the circuit.{end}{scale:1.0}{newLines:2}   Each little circuit requires a on signal to be active. This can be a pulse or a constant on signal.{end}
