Mod addon for Little Tiles. Convert Images into a Little Tile structure.

This mod requires both Little Tiles and CreativeCore made by CreativeMD. If you don't know what Little Tiles is it is an amazing mod for anyone who enjoys building in Minecraft. It is simmilar to Chisel & Bits if you know of that mod but, Little Tile has more possiblities such as making custom doors, no-clip block, or even a seatable chair. 
Now on to what this mod-addon brings to the table. You can upload any image as long as it is smaller then 128 by 128 pixels from either your desktop or url link into Minecraft as Little Tile Structure. You can also print out any block as a static texture, meaning that no matter wher you place it the texture will not move.
