Mod addon for Little Tiles. Convert Images into a Little Tile structure.

This mod requires both Little Tiles and CreativeCore made by CreativeMD. If you don't know what Little Tiles is it is an amazing mod for anyone who enjoys building in Minecraft. With this mod addon you can upload any image as long as it is smaller than 98 by 98 pixels by default from either your desktop or a URL link into Minecraft as a Little Tile Structure. You can also print out any block as a static texture, meaning that no matter where you place it the texture will not move as it does normally in Little Tiles. You can easily upload a painting or a looping texture to create wallpaper, flooring/ceiling, or get a texture for building miscellaneous structures.
